        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello! My name is Simon John. I am a student at BMCC, my major is Video Arts and Technology, and this would be my second semester. I was born in Puerto Rico, however, both of my parents were born in Dominican Reublic and I als grew up there for most of my childhood. Therefore, I would consider myself as a Dominican-Puerto Rican. I have lived here in the United States for 11 years, I moved when I was 10 years old. </p>
